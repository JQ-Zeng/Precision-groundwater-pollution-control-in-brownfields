# Groundwater ML Framework

This repository provides a comprehensive machine learning framework for assessing and managing groundwater pollution at large contaminated industrial sites.

## Modules Included

Each module has its own directory, script, README, and sample dataset.

- **WER-AM/**: Weighted autoencoder for pollutant importance ranking
- **SOM-KM/**: Self-Organizing Map + K-means clustering of hydrogeochemical data
- **DNN/**: Deep Neural Network for pollution level classification based on heavy metals
- **GBRT/**: Gradient Boosted Trees integrating rule-based and data-driven labels
- **DMVC/**: Deep Multi-View Clustering integrating multi-source features (land use, hydrochemistry, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Navigate into each module directory (e.g., `WER-AM/`)  
2. Read the local `README.md` for specific dependencies and usage instructions  
3. Run scripts with sample data or your own data in the required format
